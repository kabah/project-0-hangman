WordCatch!

WordCatch! is a browser game that stared off as Hangman. Midway through developing Hangman I decided to change the game into what it is currently.

To compare/contrast WordCatch! to Hangman, they both have a hidden word as a puzzle; in Hangman you try to guess the word before being hung, with each incorrect guess giving you a body part. In WordCatch! you try to guess as many words as you can before the timer runs out. 

This is a front end web development project utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and JQuery.

My approach was to first design a wireframe and then build a HTML/CSS mock up of the wireframe. From there I used the HTML tags in the index to build the fuctionality. 

There is no install, just load the game in your web broweser. 

Unsolved problems: Pressing Start new game while in the middle of the game does not start new game and it breaks the timer. At the end of a round the start new game button does not start a new game, it just picks up where you left off, essentially just restting the timer, but not the entire game.
